I loved Mantra's concept of teaching all aspects of social media to me in person, in great detail and with
lots of tips and tricks that I couldn't have just read up on on the internet. Johnny is very knowledgeable,
patient and very polite, not to mention good fun to work with. He has been great at adapting to my specific
needs and questions. I would warmly recommend him to anyone who wants to get their social media kickstarted!

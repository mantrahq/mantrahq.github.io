Since working with Mantra I have began to develop an understanding of the
processes involved in digital marketing with regards to my social media. The
whole process has been a vast learning curve and I feel it would have felt a
little overwhelming if it hadn’t been for Johnny’s reassurance and considered
approach. I am especially impressed with how Johnny works to specifically tailor
his knowhow to my own creative photography business. The whole experience of
working with Johnny, and working in the area of social media which before I felt
very under confident in, has been an extremely positive one. I finally feel like
I am in control things and this has given me and my business a confidence boost.
Thank you Johnny.
